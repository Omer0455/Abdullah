    <p>Abdullah‚Äôs Blog: My Day With Big People

        Hello! My name is Abdullah, and I am 1.5 years old. Today was soooo fun! I wanted to share all the things I did, because I think it‚Äôs important to tell everyone what I see.
        
        First, I woke up! I was so sleepy, but then I saw my favorite stuffed animal, and I gave it a big hug. I love my bunny. Bunny makes me feel happy.
        
        Then, I went to eat my breakfast. It was yummy! There was some mushy food in my bowl (mom calls it "porridge"), and I tried to eat it with my spoon, but I got it all over my face. Oops. It was very funny, and mom laughed, but she also helped clean me up.
        
        After breakfast, I got to play with blocks! I build big towers, and I knock them down! I love hearing the sound when the blocks crash. Boom! That was awesome! Sometimes, my big sister helps me build them taller, and I try to touch the top, but I can‚Äôt quite reach. One day I will!
        
        Oh! And guess what? I saw a dog outside. It was so cute! I waved at it, and it wagged its tail. I tried to bark, but it came out like "baba" instead. I think the dog liked it!
        
        In the afternoon, I had a nap, and after that, I played with my toy car. I like to push it all over the floor really fast. Vroom-vroom! Sometimes it bumps into the wall, and I laugh.
        
        At the end of the day, mom gave me a big hug and kissed me on the cheek. She said I‚Äôm her little sunshine. I don‚Äôt know what that means, but it sounds nice.
        
        Okay, time to sleep now. Goodnight!
        
        Love,
        Abdullah üêª</p>

            Abdullah‚Äôs Blog: Mama and Baba are My Everything

Hello! It‚Äôs me, Abdullah! Today I want to write about my Mama and Baba. They are the best people ever, and I love them so much! ‚ù§Ô∏è

Mama is so nice. She always gives me big hugs when I wake up, and she sings me songs when I feel sleepy. Sometimes, she carries me in her arms when I‚Äôm tired, and I feel so safe. Mama also makes the yummiest food! I love when she gives me my favorite snacks. She has a soft voice, and when she talks to me, I feel so happy inside.

Baba is also amazing! He plays with me and makes funny faces that make me giggle. Sometimes, Baba lifts me up high like I‚Äôm flying! I love it when Baba throws me in the air, and I can feel the wind on my face. He also helps me build my towers with blocks. We make big ones together, and Baba is really good at it. When I fall down, he tells me, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, we can try again!‚Äù I love when Baba smiles at me.

Mama and Baba are my whole world. They are always there when I need them, and when they kiss my cheek, I feel so loved. I can‚Äôt wait for tomorrow, because I get to spend another day with them.

I love you, Mama. I love you, Baba. üíñ

Goodnight!
Abdullah üåô
